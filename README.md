This is a self made project, that I decided to create after watching a funny meme on Instagram.
In that meme- someone used opanai lib in Python to fix a line in his code- so I decided to do the same- but with the whole code!
This is a simple made- GUI based AI agent which its only purpose is to fix your existing code(one file at a time), given a short statement of your code's
main purpose. after that- it will override the existing code with the new fixed one- unless its works well and it will print "Congrats" instead.
This code is using the newest version of DEEPSEEK AI generator.

MUST have Python libs to run this code:
REQUESTS lib
OS lib
TKINTER lib

Nice to have:
OPENAI lib
